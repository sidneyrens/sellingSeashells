# Sellin' Seashells

Our friend Sally is trying to take her Seashells from the Seashore business to the world wide web and has enlisted our help in designing and building out her site. 

She would like a landing page, an "about" page, and a "shop" page where people can view her merchandise. She doesn't have a preference on the colors or design, so feel free to use your imagination! Feel free to write a little copy, or you can lorem ipsum (but using [cat ipsum](http://www.catipsum.com/) is preferred)

If you'd like, you're welcome to fork this create-react-app repo as a place to start, but feel free to use something web-based or whatever you're most comfortable with!
